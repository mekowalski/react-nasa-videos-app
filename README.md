# React NASA Videos App

Creating this Videos App to have better ideas and more practice with React basics and fundamental elements

Kowalski, are you there?

## App Summary
- This NASA Videos App originally was supposed to retrieve, display and play videos searched from NASA's Images & Videos API
- I had to change this more than halfway through after finding out the the API actually does not provide videos, only video description and `srt` files
- I continued practicing writing basic React elements
- This App is quite similar to the NASA Images App
